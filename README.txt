How to use:

1. Clone repo, set path to it in Config.toml
2. Setup either cached username/password or SSH-keys without password. This will NOT automatically add/handle ssh keys!
3. Setup rest of stuff in Config.toml. You will likely want a bot account, and a token for it.
4. cargo run
5. Hopefully it works lol
